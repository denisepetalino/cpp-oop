    "### Inheritance Basics\n",
    "Allows a class, called a ***derived class***, to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from another class, known as the base class. This enables code reuse and creates a hierarchy among classes. Derived classes can extend or override the functionality of the base class using the same or new methods."

    "Where a derived class inherits attributes and behaviours from 2+ base classes. This capability supports complex class hierarchies, offering flexibility in program design. However, it also brings potential challenges like the diamond problem. Multiple inheritance is a versatile tool for encapsulating shared functionality across different base classes, while fostering reusability and modular design in C++ applications."

This allows for complex inheritance structures, promoting code reuse and better organization by extending functionality into subclasses. Multilevel inheritance links different class levels, opening up inheritance chains in a program."

This ensures that resources in the base class are ready before use in derived classes and properly released afterward. Understanding this order is paramount for effective resource management in C++."
