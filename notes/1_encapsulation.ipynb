    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "Allows data and methods to be bundled within a single class. This encapsulation keeps the internal workings, or state, of the object hidden and secure, exposing only necessary aspects through interfaces. Used to organise and manage code efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Specifiers\n",
    "`public`, `private`, `protected` help manage the visibility of class members. This enforces ***data hiding***, ensuring class internals reamin secure and inaccessible from outside the class.\n",
    "- public: full accessibility\n",
    "- private: restricts it entirely within the class\n",
    "- protected: permits access to derived classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes Overview\n",
    "Allows you to encapsulate data and functions, creating a structured template to build objects. "
