    "Enables objects of different derived classes to be accessed and processed using pointers or references to their base class type. This is achieved through virtual functions, allowing for dynamic method resolution based on the actual object type at runtime, not the pointer/reference type. Polymorphism is key in designing flexible and maintainable code."

    "In C++, compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function overloading, allowing multiple functions to share a name but have different implementations. When called, the executed function implementation is determined by the function signature. A function signature consists of the function name, the types of parameters, the number of parameters, and their order."

This ensures that the correct function is called for an object, even when it is accessed through a pointer or a reference of the base class type, facilitating dynamic behavior. Note that the base class function must be declared with the keyword `virtual`."

This supports polymorphism, enabling derived classes to override base class functions, thus allowing different implementations for shared interfaces. Polymorphic behavior is achieved via virtual functions, fostering code reusability and maintainability."

Declaring functions as virtual ensures that the correct method is called, even when handling objects through references or pointers to the base class. This plays a crucial role in runtime polymorphism. Replacing a base class method with a derived class method enhances flexibility."

    "In C++, upcasting occurs when a pointer or reference of a derived class type is cast to a base class type. It helps in achieving polymorphism by allowing access to overridden base class methods from derived class objects. This casting is implicit and safe when derived class pointers or references are used as base class pointers or references."

    "Downcasting in C++ allows you to convert a base class pointer to a derived class pointer. This is usually done when you know the object is of the derived type, but you only have access to it through a base class pointer. It’s performed using the dynamic_cast operator, ensuring type safety at runtime."

    "In C++, virtual destructors are crucial in ensuring proper resource cleanup when dealing with polymorphism. Use virtual in the base class destructor to allow derived class destructors to execute correctly when objects are deleted via a base class pointer. This prevents resource leaks and undefined behaviors in your application."
